A basic sinatra application layout with Behaviour Driven Development support. Currently, the BDD suit
include cucumber with webrat and rspec with Rack-Test.

There is no data storage, not all application need it and the data storage really depends on the type
of application being built.

I've debated about trying to package all the required gems into the vendor directory, but I haven't
really convinced myself if this is a good direction to go.  I like the idea of having all the dependency
self contained within the application.  If I need to upgrade a dependency in one application, it doesn't
effect my other applications.

Currently, you will need:

rack 1.0
nokogiri 1.0.6 or greater
